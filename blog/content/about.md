Hi and welcome everyone who stumpled upon this site, my corner of the internet. I'll *hopefully*[^1] write about various
things that piqued my interest, whether they are related to computer science, books, TV series and anything in between

So here are a few things about me:
- as of `27-10-2024` I'm a (Junior) DevOps at Intel, this being my first[^2] corporate job. I intend to write at some
point about how I got into DevOps before I even knew what it was and what are my thoughts about this branch of software
developement.
- got my bachelor degree in System Engineering and altought I enjoyed the campus life, especially before the 2020
**shutdown**, university in itself proved to be quite a big delusion and estranged me from enjoying programming related stuff.
- I've been curious about software developement since a young age, but not in the sense in which I'd go out of my way
to make this or that program/application/game etc. but rather as a `l'art pour l'art` philosophy.
- deriving on the above point, in the past year and a half I've had a growing passion for FOSS. Among the things I did
in this regard are:
    1. Switching from VsCode to NeoVim for 99% of my usecases
    2. Switching from Windows 11 to various Linux distros for my daily driving
    3. Running Arch<sup>btw</sup> and now NixOS ❄️
    4. Beggining to contribute to open source projects

    All these have reignited my somewhat lost passion of computers and also made me a better programmer.

- other than computers, I'm deeply passionated about reading and philosophy, history and politics, video games and *playing*
football.

give up after a handful of articles. I want this time to be different.
[^2]: If you'll throw an eye on my resume, you'll see I also have about 3 months of an internship at Continental, but it was a whole another area and I didn't do much there anyway
